      "block1": "The slowest band in history emerged in late 2003 between Benicàssim and Castellón, Spain, crafting an alternative rock sound shaped by classic rock influences.",
      "block2": "However, in their restless pursuit of eclectic ideas, the members of Skizophonic gravitated toward garage, soul, and especially acid sounds, blending a mod spirit with subtle electronic touches.",
      "block3": "Today, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have good taste and a discerning ear, you might appreciate them.",
